# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

:arrow_forward:  **[Live preview!](https://nekosoffy.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)**

This is an implementation of a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game where a player competes against another by clicking on the cells of a 3x3 grid. The game keeps track of scores, handles player input, and displays the current status. They can also set custom names for themselves, and have the option to restart the game's state at any point.
